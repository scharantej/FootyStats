 ## Problem Analysis

The problem is to build a footballer app and come up with the design for a Flask application. The design should include the HTML files needed for the application along with different routes.

## Design

The following is the design for a Flask application that implements a footballer app:

### HTML Files

The following HTML files are needed for the application:

* `index.html`: This is the main page of the application. It displays a list of all the footballers in the database.
* `add_footballer.html`: This page allows the user to add a new footballer to the database.
* `edit_footballer.html`: This page allows the user to edit an existing footballer in the database.
* `delete_footballer.html`: This page allows the user to delete an existing footballer from the database.

### Routes

The following routes are needed for the application:

* `/`: This route displays the main page of the application.
* `/add_footballer`: This route displays the page that allows the user to add a new footballer to the database.
* `/edit_footballer/<int:footballer_id>`: This route displays the page that allows the user to edit an existing footballer in the database.
* `/delete_footballer/<int:footballer_id>`: This route deletes an existing footballer from the database.

## Implementation

The following is the implementation of the Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for

app = Flask(__name__)

footballers = [
    {'id': 1, 'name': 'Lionel Messi', 'club': 'Barcelona'},
    {'id': 2, 'name': 'Cristiano Ronaldo', 'club': 'Juventus'},
    {'id': 3, 'name': 'Neymar', 'club': 'Paris Saint-Germain'}
]

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html', footballers=footballers)

@app.route('/add_footballer', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def add_footballer():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        name = request.form['name']
        club = request.form['club']
        new_footballer = {'id': len(footballers) + 1, 'name': name, 'club': club}
        footballers.append(new_footballer)
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('add_footballer.html')

@app.route('/edit_footballer/<int:footballer_id>', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def edit_footballer(footballer_id):
    footballer = next((footballer for footballer in footballers if footballer['id'] == footballer_id), None)
    if request.method == 'POST':
        footballer['name'] = request.form['name']
        footballer['club'] = request.form['club']
        return redirect(url_for('index'))
    return render_template('edit_footballer.html', footballer=footballer)

@app.route('/delete_footballer/<int:footballer_id>')
def delete_footballer(footballer_id):
    footballer = next((footballer for footballer in footballers if footballer['id'] == footballer_id), None)
    footballers.remove(footballer)
    return redirect(url_for('index'))

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
